## Gym Members Exercise Tracking - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset capturing gym members’ demographics, physical metrics, workout patterns, and hydration habits. The analysis aims to uncover trends, correlations, and key insights that can help inform personalized fitness and hydration recommendations.

### Project Overview
The dataset consists of 973 entries with 15 attributes, including:
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender
- **Physical Metrics**: Weight, Height, Body Mass Index (BMI), Heart Rate (Max BPM, Avg BPM, Resting BPM)
- **Workout Information**: Workout Type, Session Duration, Calories Burned, Workout Frequency
- **Hydration**: Water Intake

### Key Findings
The analysis reveals significant patterns among gym members:
- **Age & Demographics**: Most gym members are younger adults with a peak age around the mid-30s.
- **Workout Frequency & Intensity**: Members work out 3–4 times per week on average, with session durations clustering around 1–1.5 hours.
- **Calories Burned**: Longer sessions correlate with higher calories burned.
- **Hydration Habits**: Average water intake is around 2.5 liters, indicating consistent hydration.

### Visualizations
The project includes visualizations for:
- Distribution of key metrics (age, weight, height, heart rate, calories burned)
- Correlation heatmaps highlighting relationships among variables like session duration, calories burned, and workout frequency.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gym-members-eda.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to view and reproduce the analysis.

### Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data exploration

### Usage
This analysis provides a foundation for understanding fitness behaviors, helping fitness centers or individual users make data-driven decisions on workout and hydration recommendations.
